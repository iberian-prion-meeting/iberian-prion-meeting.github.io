## Registration

To register for the congress, please access the registration form (**to be included soon**).  

Deadline: April 20th, 2026.

Registration fee: xxx euros.

On Friday evening (21 May), following the long‑standing tradition of the Iberian Prion Meetings, we will host an additional optional symposium. It’s a great chance to meet new colleagues, reconnect with familiar faces, and open the door to new collaborations—or strengthen the ones you already have. The atmosphere will be relaxed, friendly, and ideal for meaningful conversations that continue advancing prion science while enjoying the company of the wider research community.

If you want to participate in the Conference Symposium (Networking about prions), you should pay an additional fee of only **45 euros**.

If you have any questions about registration, please contact: inia_iberianprion2026@inia.csic.es
