It’s a great chance to meet new colleagues, reconnect with familiar faces, and open the door to new collaborations—or strengthen the ones you already have. The atmosphere will be relaxed, friendly, and ideal for meaningful conversations that continue advancing prion science while enjoying the company of the wider research community.
