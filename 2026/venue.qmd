# Conference Venue 

The Iberian Prion Meeting 2026 will take place in one of the most iconic scientific spaces in Madrid: the Assembly Hall of the Blas Cabrera (former Rocasolano) Institute of Physical Chemistry (119 Serrano Street). This building is part of a campus with a remarkable history that shaped modern science in Spain.

## History of the venue. 

The story begins in 1932, when the Rockefeller Building was inaugurated thanks to the support of the Rockefeller Foundation. At that time, it housed the National Institute of Physics and Chemistry, a pioneering centre led by scientists such as Blas Cabrera and Enrique Moles. With state‑of‑the‑art laboratories and strong international connections, it quickly became one of the most advanced research institutes in Europe.

After the creation of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in the 1940s, part of this scientific legacy evolved into the Rocasolano Institute, formally established in 1946 and named after Antonio de Gregorio Rocasolano, a key figure in the development of physical chemistry in Spain. Since then, the institute has been home to leading research in spectroscopy, molecular physics, structural chemistry, and biophysical sciences.

Today, the Blas Cabrera Istitute continues to combine tradition and innovation, hosting cutting‑edge research while preserving the spirit of scientific curiosity that defined its origins. Its historic Assembly Hall—where the Iberian Prion Meeting 2026 will be held—has witnessed decades of lectures, discoveries, and scientific gatherings.

Celebrating the meeting here connects our community with a unique scientific heritage and offers an inspiring setting to discuss the latest advances in prion biology.

# Registration, poster sessions and coffee breaks 

While the scientific sessions of the Iberian Prion Meeting 2026 will take place in the Assembly Hall of the Rocasolano Institute, several key activities will be hosted in another historic building just a few steps away.

Registration, poster sessions, and coffee breaks will be held in the Claustro, a beautiful cloister located within the Miguel A. Catalán Physics Centre, approximately 50 metres from the main hall. This space offers a quiet, open-air atmosphere ideal for informal discussions, networking, and scientific exchange.

The Claustro is part of the CSIC’s central campus and reflects the architectural heritage of early 20th-century Spanish science. Its covered walkways and central garden provide a unique setting for poster presentations and social interaction throughout the meeting.

To reach the Claustro from the Rocasolano Institute (Assembly Hall), simply walk across the internal campus path toward the Miguel A. Catalán Physics Centre, located just beyond the Blas Cabrera Institute. The route takes less than two minutes on foot.
