    "text": "The Iberian Prion Meeting 2026 will take place in one of the most iconic scientific spaces in Madrid: the Assembly Hall of the Blas Cabrera (former Rocasolano) Institute of Physical Chemistry . This building is part of a campus with a remarkable history that shaped modern science in Spain.\nThe story begins in 1932, when the Rockefeller Building was inaugurated thanks to the support of the Rockefeller Foundation. At that time, it housed the National Institute of Physics and Chemistry, a pioneering centre led by scientists such as Blas Cabrera and Enrique Moles. With state‑of‑the‑art laboratories and strong international connections, it quickly became one of the most advanced research institutes in Europe.\nAfter the creation of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in the 1940s, part of this scientific legacy evolved into the Rocasolano Institute, formally established in 1946 and named after Antonio de Gregorio Rocasolano, a key figure in the development of physical chemistry in Spain. Since then, the institute has been home to leading research in spectroscopy, molecular physics, structural chemistry, and biophysical sciences.\nToday, the Blas Cabrera Istitute continues to combine tradition and innovation, hosting cutting‑edge research while preserving the spirit of scientific curiosity that defined its origins. Its historic Assembly Hall—where the Iberian Prion Meeting 2026 will be held—has witnessed decades of lectures, discoveries, and scientific gatherings.\nCelebrating the meeting here connects our community with a unique scientific heritage and offers an inspiring setting to discuss the latest advances in prion biology.\n\n\n\nYou can watch a short video about the history of the building here (audio in Spanish): ▶ Watch the history video"

    "text": "Madrid, Spain — 2026\nWelcome to the 14th Iberian Prion Congress in Madrid!\nThe Iberian Prion Congress has always been a multidisciplinary meeting grounded in the One Health approach, bringing together experts from diverse fields to explore the shared molecular mechanisms of prion diseases and other protein misfolding disorders that increasingly affect our aging society. This integrated perspective remains essential for advancing our understanding of these conditions and for driving the development of effective therapeutic strategies.\nWe are honored to host the 14th Iberian Prion Congress in Madrid, a major European capital distinguished by its rich political heritage and its enduring scientific tradition. This year’s meeting will take place in a historic and scientifically significant venue, a landmark institution that has played a central role in shaping biomedical research in Spain and has contributed to scientific progress on the international stage. Here, leading scientists, clinicians, biologists, veterinarians, biotechnologists, biochemists, and other specialists from across the Iberian Peninsula and beyond will gather to share knowledge and strengthen collaborative networks.\nIn particular, following the tradition of previous editions, we are committed to nurturing the participation of young scientists. Their innovative ideas, fresh perspectives, and groundbreaking research are the keys to unlocking new avenues in prion science. The congress will feature dedicated sessions and interactive discussions that offer young researchers the opportunity to present and engage with their peers, fostering an environment of mentorship and knowledge exchange beneficial to all parties.\nAs we embark on this scientific journey in Madrid, we are inspired not only by the vibrant intellectual atmosphere of this historic city but also by the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose that permeates the Iberian Prion Congress. Together, we will strive to transcend boundaries, explore new frontiers, and ultimately find solutions to the challenges posed by prion diseases.\nOn behalf of the organizing committee, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the participants, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers who have contributed to making this congress possible. Your dedication and support are instrumental in our collective pursuit of advancing prion research.\nWe eagerly await your arrival at the 14th Iberian Prion Congress in Madrid. Let us join forces, exchange knowledge, and forge new partnerships that will pave the way for a future in which prion diseases are conquered, bringing hope and relief to countless individuals affected by these devastating conditions.\nThe Organizing Committee\nImportant dates\nAbstract submission deadline: To be updated soon! — abstract page\nRegistration deadline: To be updated soon! — registration page\nCongress: 21-22 May 2026"
