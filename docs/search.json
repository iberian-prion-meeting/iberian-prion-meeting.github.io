    "text": "History of the venue.\nThe story begins in 1932, when the Rockefeller Building was inaugurated thanks to the support of the Rockefeller Foundation. At that time, it housed the National Institute of Physics and Chemistry, a pioneering centre led by scientists such as Blas Cabrera and Enrique Moles. With state‑of‑the‑art laboratories and strong international connections, it quickly became one of the most advanced research institutes in Europe.\nAfter the creation of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in the 1940s, part of this scientific legacy evolved into the Rocasolano Institute, formally established in 1946 and named after Antonio de Gregorio Rocasolano, a key figure in the development of physical chemistry in Spain. Since then, the institute has been home to leading research in spectroscopy, molecular physics, structural chemistry, and biophysical sciences.\nToday, the Blas Cabrera Istitute continues to combine tradition and innovation, hosting cutting‑edge research while preserving the spirit of scientific curiosity that defined its origins. Its historic Assembly Hall—where the Iberian Prion Meeting 2026 will be held—has witnessed decades of lectures, discoveries, and scientific gatherings.\nCelebrating the meeting here connects our community with a unique scientific heritage and offers an inspiring setting to discuss the latest advances in prion biology."
