    "text": "Madrid, Spain — 2026\nWelcome to the 14th Iberian Prion Congress in Madrid!\nThe Iberian Prion Congress has always been a multidisciplinary meeting grounded in the One Health approach, bringing together experts from diverse fields to explore the shared molecular mechanisms of prion diseases and other protein misfolding disorders that increasingly affect our aging society. This integrated perspective remains essential for advancing our understanding of these conditions and for driving the development of effective therapeutic strategies.\nWe are honored to host the 14th Iberian Prion Congress in Madrid, a major European capital distinguished by its rich political heritage and its enduring scientific tradition. This year’s meeting will take place in a historic and scientifically significant venue, a landmark institution that has played a central role in shaping biomedical research in Spain and has contributed to scientific progress on the international stage. Here, leading scientists, clinicians, biologists, veterinarians, biotechnologists, biochemists, and other specialists from across the Iberian Peninsula and beyond will gather to share knowledge and strengthen collaborative networks.\nIn particular, following the tradition of previous editions, we are committed to nurturing the participation of young scientists. Their innovative ideas, fresh perspectives, and groundbreaking research are the keys to unlocking new avenues in prion science. The congress will feature dedicated sessions and interactive discussions that offer young researchers the opportunity to present and engage with their peers, fostering an environment of mentorship and knowledge exchange beneficial to all parties.\nAs we embark on this scientific journey in Madrid, we are inspired not only by the vibrant intellectual atmosphere of this historic city but also by the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose that permeates the Iberian Prion Congress. Together, we will strive to transcend boundaries, explore new frontiers, and ultimately find solutions to the challenges posed by prion diseases.\nOn behalf of the organizing committee, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the participants, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers who have contributed to making this congress possible. Your dedication and support are instrumental in our collective pursuit of advancing prion research.\nWe eagerly await your arrival at the 14th Iberian Prion Congress in Madrid. Let us join forces, exchange knowledge, and forge new partnerships that will pave the way for a future in which prion diseases are conquered, bringing hope and relief to countless individuals affected by these devastating conditions.\nThe Organizing Committee\nImportant dates\nAbstract submission deadline: To be updated soon! — abstract page\nRegistration deadline: To be updated soon! — registration page\nCongress: 21-22 May 2026"
